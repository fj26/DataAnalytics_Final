# Factors and Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions


## Summary

This repository was created for the course project of ENV 872L Environmental Data Analytics course at Duke Nicholas School of the Environment in Spring 2020. 

Global warming resulted from greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions is one of the biggest challenges to human beings. While IPCC in its latest special report warns people the critial consequences of 1.5-degree-Celcius temperature increase from the pre-industrial level, the average global temperature on Earth has already increased by about 0.8° Celsius (1.4° Fahrenheit) since 1880. 

In the United States, in the period of 1990-2017, the temperature increase and GHG emissions have been greatly contributed by the energy sector. This was attributed to the increase electricity consumptions in all sectors by more people, and electricity generation primarily relies on fossil-fuel combustions. In addition to temperature increase, the economic features also have significant changes along the increasing GHG emissions and electricity consumption in the meantime. Understanding environmental and socioeconomic impacts of GHG emissions is significant to policy makers to consider long-term decision making. Therefore, this project examines the impacts of energy consumptions and demographic changes on GHG emissions, as well as further investigates the environmental and economic effects of GHG emissions in the United States from 1990 to 2017. 

Specifically, this project aims to study factors that might contribute to GHG emissions guided by the following questions:

1. What were impacts of US electricity consumption changes on GHG emissions from 1990 to 2017? What sectors of electricity econsumption were significant to total GHG emissions in these 28 years?
2. Was the population growth a signifant factor in affecting total GHG emissions in this period?

Following up with GHG emission causes, this project will then explore the impacts of GHG emissions in US from 1990 to 2017 guided by the following questions: 

3. Which sectors were significant to temperature anomalies in this period?
4. Was the total GHG emissions significantly related to economic development in this period, namely gross domestic product (GDP)? 

This repository contains raw data, proecessed data, codes, outputs, and a report involved this project.

## Quality assurance/quality control

To ensure the quality of this project, this project was developed from a tree graph - starting with a topic of interest, which is GHG emissions here, and exploring its resposible factors, such as population and electricity consumption, and then proceeding to another direction to consider potential impacts of this topic, which refers to economic development and temperature changes - to make sure all variables involved in this project are related to the topic, and also to conduct a comprehensive and complete project about GHG emissions.     
One essential rule to follow when collecting data among diverse sources of database is the temporal and geograhic scale of the dataset, that is all data must in the format of annual basis and cover the entire US. Monthly or daily and state-level data are also acceptable, but are at the lower priority than those data originally formatted as annual scale at the country level. 
To avoid errors and mistakenly using data, before conducting the data analysis, a boxplot is created for each dataset to detect outliers. If data for certain year or certain sector is missing, the entire year will be considered in all dataset to keep the consistency of the analysis.
